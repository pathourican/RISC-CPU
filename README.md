# RISC-CPU

## Basic RISC CPU Computer System Architecture:

### Control Unit - generates signals that control the flow of data through the Datapath during instruction execution and the access to memory
- Sequencer
- Shift Control Logic
- Condition Logic
- Control Signals Logic

 ### Datapath - Stores the information used during instruction execution, and performs arithmetic and logic operations as needed

- Program Counter
- Instruction Register
- Register File
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

### CPU - Memory Interface - 32-bit bi-directional data bus
